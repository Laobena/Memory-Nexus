 ● I've reviewed the CLAUDE.md file and understand the Memory Nexus pipeline architecture. I can see you have a comprehensive skeleton with impressive performance
  achievements already:

  Current Status Summary:

  ✅ What's Already Built (Phases 1-14):

  - Core Infrastructure: SIMD operations, lock-free cache, binary embeddings, memory pools
  - Pipeline Components: Router, preprocessor, storage, search, fusion modules
  - Performance Optimizations: Achieving 2-45ms latency (6.5ms average)
  - Production Patterns: Applied Discord/Cloudflare/TiKV patterns with 7.7x performance boost
  - Testing Infrastructure: Complete test scripts and validation tools

  🎯 New Goal: Memory Nexus Blocks System

  You want to create a modular, hot-swappable pipeline system with:
  - Zero-cost sidecar deployment mode
  - Dynamic block composition
  - C ABI for runtime hot-swapping
  - Support for 1000+ concurrent users
  - Multiple deployment modes (browser extension, local proxy, SDK, API)

  Key Differences from Current Implementation:

  1. Modularity: Current system is monolithic, new system uses hot-swappable blocks
  2. Deployment Flexibility: Add sidecar/standalone/hybrid modes
  3. Zero Cost Mode: Browser extension and local proxy with no infrastructure
  4. Dynamic Pipelines: Runtime composition vs compile-time
  5. C ABI Interface: For language-agnostic integration

  Next Steps for Phase 1:

  Would you like me to:
  1. Create the nexus-blocks workspace member with proper Cargo.toml configuration
  2. Set up the foundation with jemalloc, Tokio runtime, and SIMD utilities
  3. Define the core PipelineBlock trait with zero-cost abstractions
  4. Implement the deployment mode system (Sidecar/Standalone/Hybrid)

  The new blocks system will build on top of your existing optimized components but wrap them in a modular, hot-swappable interface.

  Ready to start Phase 1 implementation! Should I begin by creating the nexus-blocks workspace structure?
