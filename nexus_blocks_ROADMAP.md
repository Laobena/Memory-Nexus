Final Integration: Complete Package
Step 7: Production-Ready Package
xml<instructions>
Create the final production package combining all components with simple API, comprehensive documentation, and migration guides.
This should be ready for immediate production deployment.

<context>
Final package delivering:
- 98.4% accuracy (validated)
- 2-45ms latency (proven)
- 1000+ concurrent users (tested)
- Zero-cost sidecar mode (implemented)
- <5MB containers (achieved)
- Simple API (one-liner usage)
- Production monitoring (complete)
- Hot-swapping support (working)
</context>

<requirements>
- Create main package module with clean API
- Export all pre-built pipelines
- Add comprehensive documentation:
  * Getting started guide
  * API reference
  * Architecture overview
  * Performance tuning guide
  * Troubleshooting guide
  * Migration guide
- Include example applications:
  * Simple usage
  * Advanced workflows
  * Custom blocks
  * Production deployment
- Add operational tools:
  * Health check CLI
  * Performance analyzer
  * Configuration validator
  * Migration tool
- Create client libraries:
  * Rust SDK
  * Python bindings
  * JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
- Include load testing tools
- Add chaos engineering tests
- Create runbooks for operations
